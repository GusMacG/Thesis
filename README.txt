# Harnessing Machine Learning for Short-to-long Range Weather Forecasting: A Monterrey Case Study.

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase employed for my thesis on accurate weather forecasting in the city of Monterrey, Mexico, as detailed in "Harnessing Machine Learning for Short-to-long Range Weather Forecasting: A Monterrey Case Study". The study evaluates the accuracy of various machine learning models including RFR, SVR, GBR, SimpleRNN, LSTM, ConvLSTM, Stacked LSTMs, GRU, and Bidirectional RNNs in the prediction of key weather features for small geographical areas varying forecasting ranges.
